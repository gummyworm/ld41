Targets are provided as coordinates as row/column positions represented by the
onscreen grid. For example, "A1" refers to row 1, column 1. "A3" represents
row 3, column 1. You can use the cursor keys to adjust the target.

Spells are provided by typing the number of the spell. Spells are numbered
from 0-4.

To confirm a command, press `<RETURN>`.

### Tips
Level up by defeating enemies to increase your damage and health.

Be careful when TAKE'ing traps (`?`'s). They may contain health or magick, but 
they may be traps!  You can use the `EYE` spell to de-trap them if you don't
want to take chances.

You may happen upon a shop instead of a room on occasion. Here you can spend
money acquired on your travels to buy armor, weapons, spells, health, and 
magick.
